This is the FOCAL formalization in Coq.
This is written and tested with Coq 8.4pl1, but Coq 8.4 and later should be
able to compile it.
To make, simply type make clean; make.
Note that the standard UNIX tool make is expected.
You will see several warnings that Coq "could not define graph(s)."
These are normal and expected, and only indicate that Coq could not automatically generate certain induction schema.
